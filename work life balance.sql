#in department executive office  pip is exceptionally high so investigate that this is a good analysis maybe improvethis morea
	# and analysis make sure its correct and as for the other it seem to be normal since i now attrition is 51% but i hting onle 
	#executive office is teh problem sofware engineering seem to have a problem since data is weird
	# but this data has a common of admin has a higher stay with low worklife balance and the other has lefter being higher
